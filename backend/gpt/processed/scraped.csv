In order for the disease to develop, three factors must always be present: first, the susceptible organism; second, the vegetable parasite; and third, the necessary opportunity to infect. Under the last I understand all the conditions necessary to bring the virus to such a part of the living organism as will enable it to enter either into the circulation or into other body juices. Every human individual is by nature susceptible to the action of tubercle bacilli which have entered his body juices. This is true not only of human but also of bovine tubercle bacilli. I emphasize this now but shall give my proofs later. But not every tubercular infection of the tissues leads to consumption. Frequently the tubercular infection is followed by such slight disturbances of health that it remains latent throughout an entire lifetime and is only discovered at autopsy. Whether the entrance of tubercle bacilli into the tissue juices of an individual shall end disastrously or not, depends on a large number of factors. _Congenital_ differences in the degree of susceptibility undoubtedly play a subordinate rôle. A more important factor is the degree of virulence of the inoculated virus, and this may fluctuate within wide limits. Of great importance also is the amount of the virus and whether the inoculation is single, repeated, or almost continuous for a longer time. Of transcendent importance, however, are the age of the individual, his physiological or pathological condition at the time of infection, other previous diseases, mode of feeding, occupation, hygienic conditions of his surroundings, etc. In short, all that we understand by the term _acquired susceptibility_, or _acquired predisposition_. Finally, I must mention the location and character of the point of entrance of the virus. We see at once, therefore, that, in the analysis of a tubercular infection, it is not sufficient to have determined the presence of the three necessary factors, susceptibility, the tubercular virus, and the opportunity for infection. If we wish to understand the manifold variety of the reaction phenomena exhibited by an individual infected with tubercular virus, we must thoroughly study all the conditions above mentioned as well as a great variety of accidental conditions. Nowadays the term tuberculosis is applied to everything which constitutes a change in the organism excited by the entrance into it of tubercle bacilli. In statistics, galloping consumption is thus classed with tubercular local infection of a joint, gland, abdominal organ, of a little nodule in the skin of the face, etc. Calcified as well as other remains of previous lesions are classed as tubercular. We have every reason to praise as a great scientific advance the discovery that in manifestations so varied in their importance to life and health the etiological factor is the same. One must not, however, make the mistake of classing as one and the same thing tubercular infection and consumption and prognosticate an inevitable and painful end on making the diagnosis of tubercular infection. How little the facts justify such a course is seen in the statistics of bovine tuberculosis and will be seen also when I come to speak of the statistics of human tuberculosis. In studying the statistics of bovine tuberculosis of this province, I have had the hearty support of the government officials as well as of many county veterinary surgeons. After my colleague, Dr. Römer, had examined several thousand head of cattle we ceased our labors because we were confronted by the depressing fact that larger herds of cattle were rarely ever free from tuberculosis. As a test to discover the presence of tuberculosis we made use of small infections of Koch’s tuberculin. We are aware that there are tuberculous animals which do not react to this test. _On the other hand, if the method of making the test be faultless, a positive reaction always indicates that the animal in question is infected with tuberculosis._ Our figures for these cases are therefore without doubt too low. Despite this, and despite the fact that young cattle, even though infected with tuberculosis, often do not react to the usual dose of tuberculin, we found frightfully high figures for herds of more than twenty animals. We had to admit that in this respect we were no better off than other countries. I will cite one of the most experienced of the investigators of tuberculosis, Prof. Bang of Copenhagen, who says that in Denmark, in stables of more than fifty head of cattle, an average of 60% of the animals are tuberculous. Bang says further: “If one is dealing with a large herd in which tuberculosis has existed for many years, one may as well omit testing the full-grown animals. _Most of them will react, even though they appear perfectly healthy._” To this, as a result of many years’ observation, I should like to add, _and though they may apparently remain perfectly healthy for their entire life_. As a rule a herd of cattle on a large farm, though infected with tuberculosis, presents a fine appearance. Nor does their state of nutrition, milk production, or calf-raising leave anything to be desired. Now and then a cow coughs, or, despite plentiful food, loses flesh. This animal is put aside and the herd, as such, resumes its magnificent appearance. If in a herd reacting to tuberculin things are allowed to go on in this way for a number of years, especially if the cattle be barn-fed, then, to be sure, the number of coughing animals increases, the offspring deteriorate, the milk and meat production decrease, until finally the scourge of tuberculosis is plainly marked. Carefully conducted epizootic researches in our province have led me to the discovery that a single, native, mountain breed of cattle, that of Vogelsberg, was probably free from tuberculosis as late as twelve years ago. Through imported cattle the tubercular infection was then introduced. But even now the percentage of animals responding to the tuberculin test is about one-quarter that of other breeds. What is curious, however, in these cattle is, that whereas, according to common experience in all other breeds, the percentage of reacting animals increases with their age, in these Vogelsberg cattle the percentage from the fifth year on even decreases. This may depend on the smaller number of animals infected five years ago. Some of the exceptions, however, I must account for by the definite healing of lesions and a consequent disappearance of the reaction. The favorable termination of the tuberculosis in these Vogelsberg cattle I ascribe to the smaller accumulation of the tubercular virus in the still relatively little-infected stables, or, what amounts to the same thing, _to a smaller dose of the virus infecting the suckling calves. These, of course, take up the infecting agent not only from the mother cow, but also from the other cattle._ One can plainly see how the percentage of reacting cattle in this Vogelsberg breed increases from year to year, and I feel certain that ten years hence these cattle will be as badly off in this respect as other breeds, provided measures are not taken to check the advancing infection. Such measures we have had at our command for some time, and their usefulness has been thoroughly proven. I know of a large number of herds which, by means of Bang’s rules, have been made free from tuberculosis and kept so. It is, however, an expensive procedure and requires the constant supervision of an expert, and even then is usually possible only on large estates where any reacting animal may immediately be separated from the unaffected herd. When, therefore, I published a method of protective inoculation against tuberculosis, one which I had proved in my own stables, I was pleased with the spirit of hearty cooperation shown by the owners of large dairies who had already experimented largely with Bang’s procedures. Through the courtesy of Count Zedlitz I was enabled to make numerous preventative inoculations on cattle in three counties of Hesse-Nassau; from there the experiments were extended to the neighboring grand duchy of Hesse, and to the large dairy of Bolle in Köpenik near Berlin. As a result of this work I was able in the beginning of this year to establish the harmlessness of the procedure. Since then I have had abundant opportunity to inoculate calves under three months on the immense Hungarian possessions of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria; also on those of Archduke Frederick of Austria. Under my direction scientific researches regarding the protection afforded by the inoculations have been undertaken by Prof. Eber in the veterinary school of the University of Leipzig and by Prof. Schlegel in that of the University of Freiburg; further also by Ober-med. Rath Lorenz in Darmstadt and by Prof. Hutyra in Budapest. "
