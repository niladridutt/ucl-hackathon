<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Education has played, and still plays a crucial role in self-development, and in establishing oneself in society. To graduate from university opens so many doors, and gives access to a living wage, stability, and growth. Nevertheless, we are not equal when facing this adventure. Not everyone has the chance to study in a calm environment, with people able to help them revise and progress. Conversely, some can pay to get an advantage through study camps and private tutors.

Needless to say, the Covid-19 crisis has had an impact even on more privileged people, that have switched off from remote classes, and that as of today have still trouble going to school.

To help democratize the access to tutors, and in a process to help struggling students to get their foot back into studying, we present: The Reviewer.

The Reviewer is a GPT-based application that adapt to the user's level and content, and provides a new way of revising by generating novel questions and providing custom feedback.

The Reviewer can generate tailor-made questions for the user by scanning their lecture notes (either hand-written or PDFs) and using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to create a context.

The flexibility of the GPT model then allows us to generate questions and a detailed feedback, by specifying the age/level of the student. We can even go further and give a summary of the lesson, and potential further tracks of reading.

Over time, the user can now integrate The Reviewer to its revision scheme and find what best works for him.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In order to make the front-end run and test the program, you would need to install Node.js

Once it is done, just run:
  ```
  ng serve
  ```

For testing the back-end, you can use an API tester likke Postman. For the Python program, the required modules can be found in the <b>requirements.txt</b> file in the back-end folder.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once you are on the front-end web page, click <b>"Get started"</b>. You can add your picture or pdf using the top-right <b>"Add"</b> button. Once it is done, please click on the centred <b>"Start quizz"</b>. The questions will be generated, and you will have to give a complete answer to each of them.

Finally, once you've entered your answers, press <b>"Submit"</b>, and you can take a look at the marks given by The Reviewer.
